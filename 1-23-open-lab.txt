# Open Lab
1/23/2015

- Some tool tips: Vim editing - folds and marks
- Over winter break: Proposal for Center for Computation using open lab materials 
- This semester: slow down on new projects; push projects that we have into publication

## Projects in Docket:
1. Unidentified Found Object
	- Ford museum took photos, spectrometry reports; we will launch to be crowdsourced
	- Reddit, Stackexchange and Metafilter
	- Hackathon with results
	- First experiment in taking to next level
	- Linguistics an Literature in Computatlon
	- Dennis wrote a chapter on early history of the telegraph; cyanide early experimentation in recording medium
		- telegraph timelines synchronized
2. Reschedule Public Books
3. NYC Folktech
	- bring photographs; pick 3-4 and do interviews

## New projects:
1. Center for Justice and Caesar - Digital literacy at Rikers Island
	- What is the timeline for the workshops 
2. Consensus in scientific literature 
	- We currently have the corpus of Journal for Computational Linguistics
	- acquiring the whole Web of Science dataset
	- working with Networking guy from Stanford
	- NLTK
	- Current paradigm: “Eureka-alert” announces new scientific findings
	- We want to be able to quickly contextualize a new work and historicize trends in scientific consensus
3.  500k book reviews from Reddit and book clubs
	- We have this dataset
	- Ed Finn helped with this
	- comp. language about literature to, say, Public Books reviews
	- look at the corpus and describe the corpus
	- what is the social experience
	- we have usernames, so we could track influence
4. Frances Negron 
	- The show “Jane the Virgin” is going to be canceled
	- Have a form online 
5. Small Axe
	- Reduce the cost of publishing
	- Create an issue of the journal in Markdown and Pandoc
	- Have John MacFarlane come and see if we can add an editing function
	- The Markdown edit function could be rolled out with the Small Axe 
	- Penflip = GoogleDocs-styled collaborative editor for markdown files, so that we could have this be read by their interface.
	- Visualizing edits in a network diagram (Shelley-Godwin archive)
	- Possibly a LaTex stylesheet for MLA-style formatting
6. Concluding Lecture Series on Method in the Humanities
	- Martha Nell Smith
	- Brent Smith

## Studio Events:
- Sebastian Chen - 3D museum stuff
- Miguel Ripole - Spanish web designer
- Steve Jones - the early history of DH in New York
	- Father Busa & Watson
- Possibly Miriam Posner

## Center for Justice @ Columbia
- Education, research, and policy
- programming for RNDC - youth (16-17)
- Timeline: summer/fall 
 - monthlong workshops on saturdays; 3 hrs each (though flexible, poss. multiple running at once?)
- team-based projects
- restorative practices : we want to create a project where we don’t come in and lecture
	- Columbia students will be paired with young people there
- What kinds of projects?
	- Ideally, have the skills fed in and result in employment
- Beats Rhymes and Justice - sound engineering; using iPods
- Difficulties & Logistics
	- no internet
- Social Enterprise Startup - helping young people think up a for-profit business models
