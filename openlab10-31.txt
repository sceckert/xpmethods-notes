xpmethods
now partners with Columbia Center for Interational History 
[NB we need a mailing list to clip in with in the English]
[How do we communicate to the larger CU community? + subscription]
ADI [undergrad hacker list] == > we should spin up a mediate machine
e.g.:How to tweet annotations

### XPMethods Triage Meetings
3pm - meeting every Fridays - go over the projects and give updates, add new projects
Mixture of different authors — questions of authorship
- part of our ethos should be fair attribution. 
- we’re modeling for other institutions how to do co-authorship CORRECTLY
- this is a portfolio and we want a Columbia flavor to this work
- these project should be small and high impact
- e.g. OSP is high funding, long term, etc
- we don’t want to be in the business of supporting a slog of these big long term things

### Tasks:
- on the _posts/projects we have all the ongoing projects; in the “archive” are the ones that are done. 
- On Fridays we will go through this. Some of this will require organizing people and facilitating things
- clearly designate who is driving what project

### Current projects:
- Big Round Table: Michael Shapiro and the Journalism school — reinventing and reinvigorating long-form journalism [link](http://www.thebigroundtable.com/)
- What they’re struggling with: monetizing long form journalism
	- UI: how do we make the user -interface better
	- they’re going to take the lead on these projects. 
- P1: “Story Support”
	- daylong workshop and hackathon
	- we’re going to add a bit coin tip jar on every story
	- The article will say “supported by…” and list all of the readers
		- we can do this quickly in a hackathon
	- There will be a quick bit coin workshop/hackathon — Not paypal? Bitcoin will get them in the news
		- this could be expanded 
- P2: “Prints not Debt”
	- publishing the stories with amazon shorts — but they don’t want to work with Amazon
	- we can very easily create a nicely typeset pdf that you could print. 
	- $0.99 —> typeset workflow for publishing (we have expertise in this)
		- we can do this in one hackathon
		- high

- P3: “NYCFolktech”
	- how people hack things in real world
		- Margaret Halloway
		- email in photos, etc
	- write with Margaret on case study 

- P4: “Humanities Defense Patent Portfolio”
	- how can we subvert the patent culture
	- when you look into IP rights around literary technology 
		- the patenting of things that should not be patented
	- we’re taking lead on this and we’re going to go forward on patenting 
		- workshop on patenting
			- IP and patenting 


For the website: 
we can use github to organize the issues
	- channel everyone into gitbhub 
	- use the project management stuff
	- used for scheduling
	- we can add small, private repository
		- github workshop 

Projects on the back burner:
	- “published: false” — switch this to being true to publish
	- you just need a description to post. 


To do:

- mailinglist 
- invite other students
	- e.g. Jeremy, Matt - send an email 


our website:
- eventually: xpmeth.plaintext.io
.plaintext.io 
xpmeth.plaintext.io/
make third tier
	- a name for less expensive hosting (for denten.plaint.in )
