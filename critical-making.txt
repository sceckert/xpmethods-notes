# Pamela Smith: Critical Making: The Making and Knowing Project
- Prompt, provocation - > then, we will meet and discuss as a group
- Grant: what do experiments look like?
Intro, followed by an opening convo

## Intro
- contestation of the opposition between he workshop and the laboratory
- how did craftspeople contribute to scientific revolution?
- long sense of “craft”: engagement of human bodies with the material world
- the bracketed space of the scientific laboratory is a nth
- Smith’s work “ Lived experience to Written Word”
	- the problem of recovering “skill”
	- ceramic models of lived things
	- Bernard Palissy 1510-1590s
		- practice and theory; “you will still make a thousand mistakes.. and even if you had them in writing you would not believe them until practice has given a thousand afflictions”
		- What evidence do we have? Books, images, emergent “how-to”: The Book of Secrets (15 Alessio Piemontese) book of technical recipes
	- Why did this flood of technical literature appear?
- Current problems:
	- the problem of reproducibility in natural sciences
	- response: Jove, a Journal of Visualized Experiments
- How do we get at this knowledge: apprentice-ship
	- reconstructions
	- there are historical techniques of painting class
	- nb: no one in history of sci, art history know the material
- Where do you do this? Victorian Albert museum
	- site for archiving processes that are important for the nation
	- West Dean College of Arts
- Examples:
	-The Chymistry of Isaac Newton
		- we can see that metaphors are actually real
	- Life Casting: the casting in metal of flowers, etc.16th century
		- there are differing accounts/instructions
- Reconstruction: a mix of museum, textual, and reverse engineering
	- what kind of historical evidence is available to historians of life in the past
	- what did they mean to people
	- when you reconstruct, you’re dealing with an emergent phenomenon (in the present) with something in the past.  YOU NEVER HAVE THE SAME THING
	- problem of evidence here — yet this is also a problem of archival documents
		- we don’t think about archival documents as emergent phenomena

## The Making and Knowing Project
- 1. Middle French Paleography Workshop June 2014
	- 340 page manuscript 
	- collectively produced (91+) critical edition that is translated and annotated
	- learned paleography, then worked in pairs
	- Workflow
		- Google drive
			- each page has a folder with hi depth picture and a translation
			- transcription, normalized transcription, and translation
			- kept as simple as possible
		- problems:
			- different permission access
			- google keeps changing
			- retrospective correction
	- Power of Collective work: 
		- collectively constructed resources of id’ing books, art, etc, all online
		- collectively compiled vocabulary 
- 2. Craft and Science Laboratory Seminar
	- history seminar where the research is done in the laboratory. This year is mold-making and metal-making technical recipes
		- Test: make recipe
		- How do you record everything? Field notes 
		- How do you take lab notes? 
	- How do you organize this information? **KEY**
		- wiki
		- annotation: multi-media essays uploaded to the wiki
			- these include lots of primary source work on recipe genealogies
		- example: bread molding (used to test out moldes)
- 3. Expert Oversight and Digital Edition
	- happening in May, the oversight, the students come together to compile annotations
	- the Met scholars asked the students for their feedback 
	- Questions:
		- what we want it to do and what we want it to look like?
	- NB: continuity of techniques (like “lizard catching”)
		- the intersection of scientific knowledge required to find materials and artistic knowledge

## Our Problems:
1. Coordinating access and permissions to Google
2. Organizing the Archive and WikiSpace
	- tagging in Flickr
	- extensive documentation of materials
	- how do you organize this?
	- How do you make these things speak to one another?
		- consistent tagging
	- Embed iframes of the googledrive into the Wiki (is iframe really the right way to go?)
3. Scaling up and Collaboration
	- scaling up next semester to collaboration with U Glascow, Bard, Amsteram, VNA, Cologne institute for conservation
	- they will perform same recipes and do additional annotations
	- virtual conferencing and collaboration in real time
		- Big Blue Button? Blue Jeans?

## Discussion:
- version control
	- for text
	- there is version control for video
- the problem with GoogleDrive and YouTube - should be in openly accessible system that is friendly to API access
	- two partners
		- WikiMedia foundations, the fact that they’re in place for storing 
		- Internet Archive
- access control 
- what kind of uses do you envision? 
	- multiple uses, iterations
	- classroom, pedagogy, modeling, resource for
- differences between collaboration and publishing
	- have CS class working on questions of digital/collaborative knowledge production synchronously with the critical making project
	- computing in context with DAVID BLEI — TALK TO DAVID AND DAVID MIMNO ABOUT THIS
- why isn’t digital making folded into this as well? 
- how to collaborate well online is not well covered anywhere?
- the question of successful collaboration:
	- peer-production: how do you ensure for successful moderation = editorial model 
- how do you capture knowledge produced by the project?


what they need: 
- a metadata schema
- what are the affordances of the traditional model
- how can we preserve the multiplicity of knowledge
- how do we produce a platform agnostic
- tagging? tags can become obsolete 
- the schema question?
- what is the goal? what is the deliverable

Small group discussion:
- version control via Github
	- students can use the UI if they don’t want to use the command line
- YEML for metadata
	- arbitrary data structure 
	- can include images in the metadata
	- JSON data

Create a new project in XPMethods, “Field Notes”
- get the markdown source materials 
- create a directory with images
- upload the manuscript
- where do the images live? Flickr is a problem
	- would wikimedia? 
	- let’s put one images on wikimedia commons
- create a directory structure
- upload and link to wikimedia commons


What we need from the Making and Knowing project:
- a stylesheet or guide on what TEI protocols have been used
- a
